SCENE I
Before the curtain rises, Christinas chimes arc heard,
playing distinctly,—“Christians, awake! Salute the happy morn, Whereon the Savior of mankind was born!*
A t the close of the chimes a pause of jo seconds absolute silence; after which there sounds shrill and clear a
single stroke of a bell. The curtain rises, disclosing a
room of a humble family of three children. “ The little
Mother" is busy about the evening meal; Nannette is
setting the table; Annikins, on the floor, cuts pictures
for paper dolls.
NANNETTE. What are the bells ringing for?
HANNAH. Why, don’t you know dear? They're ringing
for the Christmas Child—for His birthday. This is Christmas E ve!
ANNIKINS. Is Christ Child coming here?
HANNAH. (Thoughtfully) Why yes, Annikins. He will
come to us if we try to be kind and good.
NANNETTE. Sister, can’t we possibly have a Christmas
tree this year ?
HANNAH. I’m afraid not, deary. But we’ll try to be happy
just the same. We’ll play “make believe’’ and make each
other wonderful presents. It's lots of fun! And write
letters to Daddy, and we’ll ask the Christ Child to bring
Daddy safe home to us, and then mother will not have to
work so hard down town. And we’ll ask the Christ Child
to bring us sweet Peace and Good Will. Because lie is the
Prince of Peace, and that’s what He is coming for. And
then I s'pose we ought to pray for Democracy, ’cause
that’s what Daddy is fighting for.
